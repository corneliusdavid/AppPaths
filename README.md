# AppPaths
Simple Delphi cross-platform app to list the standard paths available on various platforms.
Uses the `System.IOUtils` unit to show the value of several `TPath` functions.

For example: `TPath.GetHomePath`, `TPath.GetDocumentsPath`

Run it on different platforms--you may be surprised what's available and what's not!
